# ParkinsonDiseaseDetection
Parkinson's Disease Detection using Python and Machine Learning.

This personal project aimed to detect Parkinson's disease using ML techniques. A dataset containing various biomedical voice measurements from patients along with data preprocessing, feature selection, and multiple ML models was used to classify patients as either Parkinson's Positive (1) or Parkinson's Negative (0). 

Please feel free to use this model with your own datasets!! I plan to deploy a user-friendly web-application soon.
